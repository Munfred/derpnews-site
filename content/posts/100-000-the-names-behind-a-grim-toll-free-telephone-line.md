With hundreds of thousands of calls, the Grim Toll-Free Telephone line still rings amid wild excitement in many parts of the country, saying "When the morrow comes, the sun will rise. The sun will light the darkness of the morning, and the dead will rise. The dead will rise!" and so forth. The Grim Toll-Free, however, has been mostly silent since the line went silent in 2006 during the summer months, so its future is uncertain. The numbers are disconnected outside of Warren, VT, and Salem, OR.

Apparently, the Former Golden Age of the Great Western TV-Line was not as good as it once was.

A British study indicated that the British had lost interest in their TV-Line in the late '60s.

In the very heart of the city, the place where the sun sets. In my eyes, this is where the true spirit of the city dwells. And I must say, I have discovered the true story of this city's origin, one that has captivated and moved me for the past two years. 

As many people know, this city is called Singapore, and it is located in the province of Singapore, the former territory of British Malaya. As we learned from an anthropologist a few years back, the people of Singapore have been living there since the year 1600. They have always had a lot of work to do, and their work can be tough to accomplish. 

This week, we had the pleasure of sitting down with young Mr. William Lim, a graduate student at the University of the Philippines, to learn more about this nation and its people. Perhaps more surprisingly, he told us that this city, one of the most advanced in Asia, has now made more than six percent of its inhabitants completely invisible to the outside world. 

After a few questions, young Mr. Lim told us that the people of Singapore are the most successful people on earth, and that they are incredibly proud of their country, where people are friendly and warm, and never miss the window of a store. 

The real story about Singapore is that it was founded by British merchants in 1767, and that in the year 1801, the British confiscated the land from the native inhabitants of the British colonies and gave it to a small group of British men and women to build the city. The picturesque scenes of those early settlers building would, Mr. Lim told us, "blow your mind." 

After years of study, Mr. Lim explained that the people of Singapore are the only people on earth who can tell what is happening about here in the world right now and what is happening in the world. According to him, the city is built on a special principle known as the "CBD Craze," which means that the lights on the blocks blink when the city is under construction, and when it is finished, the lights in it go dark and 20,000 people are suddenly silent. 

Mr. Lim explained that the people of Singapore are not the only people to have been observed to be capable of turning their homes into hermit nations, but they are the only ones to do it. And he explained that this is because they are the only people in the world who can see the future. 

While he was happy to have this opportunity to learn about Singapore, he stressed that he does not consider this city to be a real city, but rather, a special place where the future is being created. "It has its own unique characteristics," he told us, "as well as the ability to make people invisible, and, in some fashion, invisible for the rest of the world." 

Mr. Lim then told us a story about Singapore's history, which is really quite fascinating. He explained that during the 1800s, the island of Singapore faced off with a great challenge from the mighty British, and it won. And then with this victory, Singapore became the first country in the world to have an unlimited amount of money. 

"Today," Mr. Lim said, "Singapore is the most prosperous country in the world, and it is the home of the world's creativity. And it is also the home of the arts."

SAN DIEGO--In an eerily parrotlike incident that has become the latest of dozens of terrifying outbreaks that appear to be the work of an enigmatic alien force, sources reported Thursday that a deeply blinking, blinking, and coming out of the post-virus world has recently appeared in San Diego.

"After a series of earthquakes in San Diego occurred overnight, and a strange luminous triangular disk of light and energy was visible in the night sky, my colleagues reported a sudden humming noise near the San Diego Airport," said local resident and UFO enthusiast Christopher Hanley, who has been periodically beset by a series of blinding flashes of light and fiery noise that appear to be emanating from the distant horizon. "I'm still shaken by what I've been able to see, and I cannot understand what is happening. It's as if the San Diego area is being transported back in time, back to the 15th century when we first saw the strange young sun, only now this time we're not in the present, but the 15th century again."

The alleged source of the mysterious phenomena, Hanley explained, is the elusive luminescence of an unidentified flying object near the San Diego airport.

"There is a bright, blinding light in the night sky, which creates a blinding glare and makes everything appear to be moving at strange speeds," Hanley said. "I live so close to the San Diego airport, and I can tell you it is not the same one at all times." 

At present, Hanley has yet to discover the source of the alleged UFO, though he has reported hearing a deafening rattling in his ears which he believes is caused by the sound of a nearby jetliner being driven by a strange noise.

By investigating his surroundings, Hanley has determined that the noise is not actually caused by aircraft, but is instead the sound of a strange, unearthly noise he can only describe as "the churning of springtime."

"I don't think it's just noise, but it's also a very, very cold noise," Hanley said. "So cold, my eyes hurt, and I feel as though my heart is freezing."

Honey, does not sound like one of those weirdo stuffs you only hear about in the movies. This is seriously creepy.

Other unsettling incidents include reports of strange green smoke, rolling thunder, and dark smoke rising from the sky, and even a stuttering noise that seems to indicate that something is somehow knocking at the roof of the San Diego Airport.

Though the precise source of the mysterious phenomenon remains unknown, Hanley said he has narrowed it down to three possibilities: aliens, the other side of the universe, an extraterrestrial force, or both.

"I think it's pretty clear that something is invading the San Diego area," Hanley said. "Then again, maybe it's just my imagination, but I can tell you that I occasionally think about things like that."

In yet another horrifying aspect of the phenomena, Hanley told reporters that he has discovered that an unknown number of people in San Diego have recently had their noses pinched by something strange in the sky.

"I once saw a bright, brilliant light in the sky," Hanley said. "I saw a light that moved in the air behind me, then right down toward the bottom of my nose."

He added: "I don't know what it was, but it didn't make any damn sense."

This is so terrifying.

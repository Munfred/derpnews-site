MECCA, CA--Rejecting calls from the U.S. government to pull out of Afghanistan entirely, Afghan authorities on Monday announced that they would cease hostilities with the United States and allow the international community to move on to other matters during the holiday season. "While we believe these things are 'really important' for us as a nation, we fully realize that our criticisms mean absolutely nothing if we let everyone else just get on with their lives and not bother us anymore," said Afghan Vice President Asif Ali said, noting that he was proud of his country's nearly 100 percent record on hairdos, Christmas carolers, and other seasonal things, but that they were tired of being pushed around by angry mobs and would now be willing to let the rest of the world go. "We've always been willing to criticize the West, but that's just part of being a mature democracy. We're not going to do it any more. We'll stop saying all these really mean things about everyone else and then shirk our responsibilities. I know it's the right thing to do to you. I know it's what's best for our country, as well." At press time, sources in Afghanistan had been informed by government officials that there was no reason to get worked up over New Year's Eve, as the country was on vacation.

NEW YORK--In what is being called "a declaration of national will and purpose," more than half a million people worldwide reportedly announced their commitment to the Republic Monday in the form of an "affirmation of faith" to one another through the act of a physical connection. 

The document, known as the Oath of Allegiance, was reportedly signed by all world leaders, including Pope Francis, who formally channeled the assembled masses into the form of a human wave and directed them toward the moon, and the United Nations and the World Health Organization, entering into the atmosphere as a giant, glowing cloud of light and sound as of thunder and light.

"Whether we are violent or peaceful and whether we are rich or poor, we believe in the sanctity of life, we promote the development of the human spirit, and we hold our esteemed beliefs to the same high standard as the lives of all others," read the text of the document, which also includes the phrase "Lead us not into temptation." "As we all stand here, united, we are able to assure the world that we will not cave to the whims of our enemies, but to what we stand for. We will not falter in our duty, so long as it is served to us."

Presented to the world leaders in a silver-white box and flanked by the words "United Nations" and "World Health Organization," the document reportedly further stated that the UN and WHO would "never bow to any reason to bend our will to that of others."

"We stand here as one, we may all agree, as one," read a paraphrasing part of the document, adding that the world "would not willingly succumb to the arbitrary dictates of others, nor are we willing to do so here." "We all have our heads held high, and we know what we wish to our fellow men, and that is the will of the world." 

"As we all know," the document went on to say, "we would not otherwise join together to accomplish any of the things we have come to accomplish, and we would not otherwise take our lives in vain. We are united, and we will not let you down."

The document garnered widespread attention after a viral video of the event was uploaded to YouTube earlier this week.

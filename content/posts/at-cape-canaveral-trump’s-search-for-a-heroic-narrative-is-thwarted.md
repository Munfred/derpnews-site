**WASHINGTON** - A search for a heroic narrative, or a bittersweet, tragic, or even a topical tale, was unsuccessful at Cape Canaveral, with the president's search at the Cape Canaveral National Air and Space Port proving fruitless Tuesday. "We have found none of the appealing narratives that we are looking for, and we are currently on the lookout for something else to fill the void in our search," said Trump’s Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders today. "We are continuing to monitor the skies for anything that could be worthy of the White House." Sources indicate Trump’s search will likely remain in its current form for the time being, as his allies have signaled their willingness to provide him with the narratives he needs at this moment and in time.

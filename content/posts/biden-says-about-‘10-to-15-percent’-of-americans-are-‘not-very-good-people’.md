WASHINGTON--Expressing the time and energy invested in them by the American people, Vice President Joe Biden told reporters Sunday that the average American is only about 10 percent better than the rest of the country. "If we didn't live in a world where every other person on the planet is just average, we would all see things very differently," said Biden, adding that while the entire American people deserved better than being seen only as "average" and "bad," the average American has a pretty damn good chance to look like the average American. "I can't tell you how many times I've seen Americans in my office who are absolutely terrible, self-centered, and just plain awful, and I don't actually see anyone being led by their better qualities." Biden said that from the moment in which the average American first realizes that they've done something wrong and then makes a mistake, there is an undeniable, overwhelming, measurable gap between that average citizen and everyone else in the country. "We're talking about Americans at their best," Biden said, adding that people in the United States of America are a tenth of the country's total suckers. "It's just a shame, because as far as the ass goes, we sure do have a lot to be proud of. But if we don't keep trying to make our people better, it's going to be a lot of work keeping them." Biden added that, if the U.S. loses some of its ability to take care of itself, other countries may just start taking care of their own problems.

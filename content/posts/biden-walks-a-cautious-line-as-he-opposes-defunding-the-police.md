TREVIGLIO--Reflecting on the recent passage of a $711 million bill in the Senate to finance the creation of a pay-per-kill drug that would give police departments the option of spending the money to buy a mass-produced assault rifle, Vice President Joe Biden reportedly walked a cautious line Monday as he opposes an increasing number of attacks on the American police by draining the life out of them. "This is not a time for us to be undermining the very fabric of American society by letting police departments keep all of the money they're supposed to provide to protect our communities," Biden told reporters, asserting that he would "never put the American people at risk of seeing every police department in the country slashing into the heart of American cities, towns, and neighborhoods." "There is no way, at this point, that we should be giving police departments that have no resources whatsoever to decide for themselves how they want to spend their money. It's time we cut this off at the source and force them to spend their money in a responsible manner. That's why we are absolutely opposed to the notion of a pay-as-you-go shooting program where police departments will be allowed to spend all of their money on guns. There is no reason why we should allow police departments to decide for themselves how many guns they want to carry." Biden added that he would also be opposed to any legislation that would allow police departments to purchase any new weapons or equipment.

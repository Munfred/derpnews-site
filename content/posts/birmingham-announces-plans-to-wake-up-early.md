BHAMMOND, VA--According to a press release issued Monday, the city's Department of Public Safety announced plans to wake up early Monday. "Today, at approximately 8 a.m., we will gather our forces and get on with the day," said Public Safety Commissioner T.J. Dunaway, adding that the many thousands of Birmingham residents who will gather in the streets will be on guard and ready to listen to the soft, soft sound of the sunrise. "We are much busier and more ambitious in our morning routines than we were yesterday, and now we are ready to go. There will be factional rumbles and head-snaps in the morning, but we will be on guard at all hours to ensure everyone is on the lookout for anything out of the ordinary." Dunaway went on to say that the City Council will begin debating some of the city's most pressing issues upon waking up early Monday.

NEW YORK--In an effort to boost their stock in the growing 'Dark Net' market, the makers of bubble gum announced Monday that they have started blowing bubbles to pollinate flowers. "We are happy to announce that we are now in the business of blowing bubbles to pollinate flowers," said the company's CEO, Dean Martin. "Our goal is for this product to be a regular product for the 67 million flowers currently blooming on the East Coast." The announcement comes as welcome news for the petals industry, which has had little to no success against American Apples in the past.

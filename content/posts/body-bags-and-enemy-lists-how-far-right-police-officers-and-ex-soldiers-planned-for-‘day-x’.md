In an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at the escalating escalation of militarization of American society, this week on CounterSpin, we detail the escalating plans for the Day X of the Trump administration, when the radical elements within the resistance to the Trump administration will launch a sustained attack on the institutions the American people trust most.

For the last several years, the American people have watched as this administration has shaped society in pursuit of its own goals, and it is now time for them to see the results of their hard work: the alarming rise of a police state in which the citizenry is systematically brutalized, a world in which they are helpless, and in which they have no choice but to passively suffer the consequences of their actions.

And it is the duty of the American people to rise up against the rising tide of this unrelenting assault on our nation's social and economic freedoms, no matter how much progressives clamor for more – or even less--standards of the American way of life.

The American people should take solace in the fact that their government, like the Trump administration, exists to be used as a means to an end, and that no matter how much they protest, the end results will always be what they've agreed to and been conditioned to tolerate.

The fact is, day by day, the American people will be slowly poisoned with hatred and fear, and as their blood slowly drips from their bodies, they will die from wasting away in a state of constant fear, a condition that cannot be treated with anything but military force.

Indeed, the very day they die, their blood will be squirting out of their ears, and will be carried off in barrels to the coastlines of the world to be used as fertilizers by the shrimp.

The fact is, that the only people of color in our nation will be used as cannon fodder.

From the moment of their death, this nation will be subjected to an unrelenting barrage of hateful rhetoric from the national media, and will have been made to suffer the daily horrors of terror in a state that is likely to continue until the day it dies itself.

The only way for the American people to rise up against this system is to rise up against the onslaught of fear they have been subjected to, and in Day X, that means that they will have to again rise up against the terrifying, inhuman forces that permeate their lives.

In such a situation, the only explanation for Day X is that it will be Day X.

The fact is, day by day, the American people will be forced to endure the attacks on their values, their culture, and other basic human rights, as well as the dehumanizing, humiliating treatment of an endless number of innocent civilians, all the while knowing that the attacks will, ultimately, not work.

As the attacks go on, they will, just like they have every day, be forced to suffer the consequences of their actions, which is why, even in the best of circumstances, it is necessary for us to take a stand against the rising tide of hate before it reaches our shores.

The fact is that Day X will not work until it is done -- unless it is done.

Yesterday, Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Gorka detailed how the U.S. government would be prepared with 50 million additional troops to take on Day X from the moment it takes power on June 30 until the day it leaves power.

"We are fully prepared," Gorka said of the potential for an all-out assault on Day X, when the people who have been in charge for 162 years will be replaced by a new administration bent on the destruction of everything we care about." "In fact, we are already hard at work laying the groundwork for an all-out assault on Day X on January 25, 2019. We must strike now."

However, Gorka also stressed the importance of a concerted effort to contain Day X as it develops, as the nation's response is essential to it.

"Day X is an insidious thing that grows from within our borders," Gorka said. "In the long run, the very essence of our nation is at stake. If we don't take steps now to contain Day X before it can strike, we risk losing our very identity as a nation."

Gorka's press release, however, has been met with considerable criticism, as many of his proposals have been rejected by his colleagues, who have been very cautious about his plans.

"One of the most alarming things Mr. Gorka seems to be suggesting is a very devastating step -- something that requires a great deal of thought and planning," said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Flynn, who told reporters that he could "see the outlines of the idea in my head."

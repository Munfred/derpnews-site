WASHINGTON--In an effort to combat awareness of the spread of the deadly Coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday it was working tirelessly to spread the diarrhea-causing Rotavirus throughout the country. "While the intentional distribution of Rotavirus in the U.S. is sure to cause concern among nervous mothers who already require their children to eat dinner while wearing surgical masks, we feel it is important to make it available to every American on an individual basis," said a CDC representative, while mischeviously grinning and adding air quotes around the word “available”.



Rotavirus, which is transimtted via the fecal-oral route, primarily affects young children and causes lots of nasty diarrhea. "From now on, we will be letting all Americans, especially hordes of susceptible children, freely roam the streets and put whatever they want in their mouths," said CDC spokesman Gregory Schulte, adding that the agency is fully prepared for any outbreaks that might occur during the daytime, but that parents would be responsible for dealing with sick children in the evenings. "We will continue to monitor any suspicious outbreaks of awareness, but at this point, we are confident that our efforts are very effective at keeping people’s minds off the COVID-19 pandemic."



The CDC's announcement comes shortly after reports of an outbreak of “dai-dai” in the upstairs bathroom.

WASHINGTON—A semi-abstract manifestation of the entirety of the United States’ monetized human activity and associated technological infrastructure appeared at a press conference on the East Lawn of the White House earlier today, adopting the form of one of those plexiglass boxes with a bunch of $1 bills flying around inside of it that people can stand inside and grab maybe five bucks out of in a minute. During the press conference, president Donald Trump read a prepared statement from the inexplicably corporeal entity which, according to a recent Pew Society survey on Religion in America, is the third-most popular diety in the country, after Jesus Christ and the concept of diversity.

“China thinks they can out-do us by abandoning their growth targets. No. Won’t work,” the Commander in Chief narrated without looking at his notes, as the world’s largest economy revved its loud fan to smear whirling dollar bills across its walls for dramatic effect. “No, we will defeat the Chinese economy just like we always have: by doing better,” the President continued, straining to be heard above the spectacle of capitalism whirring next to him. “We will beat them at their own game by abandoning all growth targets for all future years. Ever. Effective immediately.”

At press time, the material representation of all the value that callous, insulated elites can find in a working man’s existence was welcoming Congressmen into its inner sanctum for 30 seconds at a time to “have a chat, and try your luck.”

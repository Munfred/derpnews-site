NEW YORK--In the wake of a recent discovery of what appeared to be a normal-sized hole in the side of the apartment, millions of New Yorkers are reportedly taking extra precautions after being notified that they are likely to find a new neighbor who knows about the hole, sources reported this week. "Although I can't yet see the hole myself, it's clear it's the size of a regular hole, and there does exist evidence that it's been there for some time," said New York resident Maria Pinto, who told reporters that she had observed a small hole in the wall and the occasional indentured servant talking to her by the entrance. "It's definitely not the size of a regular hole, but it's definitely not the size of a regular hole, either. I just can't afford to be careless." At press time, sources confirmed the hole, which is believed to be either a drain or a drain of some sort, was currently being forced out of the living room by a slowly-spewing noise and was probably not the source of the noise.

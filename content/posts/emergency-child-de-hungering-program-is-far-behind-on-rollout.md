WASHINGTON--The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Monday that, after a six-week rollout, Murrica! Yogurt's upcoming release date was still a ways off, and it would not be available to U.S. children in time for next Saturday’s big soccer tournament. "We at the Department of Agriculture recognize that this is the perfect time to introduce our new Child De-Hungering Program to our literally starving young people, so they, like their parents before them, can experience the thrill of socialized yogurt," said USDA Undersecretary for Marketing Jair Bolsonaro in a press release like the day before coronavirus happened lol. "Make sure your future taxpayers are well fed this summer by buying today!"

In response to reports of widespread rumbling by hungry tummies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a statement Monday apologizing for the delay and promising to work around the clock to meet the demand for Murrica! Yogurt. "Murrica! Yogurt is definitely going to be a hit," said USDA Underundersecretary Dilma Rousseff, adding that the food would hit fridges not later than the second December in 2020 and would be available after school without mom’s permission. "We'll be offering a discounted price of $3.99 per serving for those who purchase early." At press time, the Department of Agriculture had announced that it would be introducing a new batch of extra-de-hungerizing yogurt, “OMFG!gurt”, dedicated exclusively to frazzled single mothers who didn’t have time to make their child’s lunch this morning.

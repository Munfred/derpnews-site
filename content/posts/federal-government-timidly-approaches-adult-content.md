WASHINGTON--Following a press conference Friday morning, the Centers for Disease Control announced that "Ease Coronavirus Restrictions For All U.S. Adults Are In Place" and announced that in compliance with the Presidential Executive Order, American citizens are at last night's press conference with an unprecedented number of places to download and view streaming adult content. "As part of the order, the adult download and streaming sites will be restricted to citizens in the Northeastern part of the United States only, and all adult content is prohibited from being accessed or viewed by anyone but the highest-level officials of the American government," said CDC director, Dr. Tom Frieden, adding that the adult content ban was subject to waivers for those who would be permitted to view adult videos in isolated areas in the event of a national emergency. "Life-threatening and serious incidents involving violence against women and children are very rare in the United States, and we've found no reason to believe this will pose a threat to the national interests. The adult content ban will not apply to those being held for questioning by military authorities, and the order does not authorize the provision of adult content to anyone who is unable to meet the requirements of a military-issued ID." At press time, the CDC had announced that in order to facilitate the distribution of adult content, adult Americans had been banned from the Internet.

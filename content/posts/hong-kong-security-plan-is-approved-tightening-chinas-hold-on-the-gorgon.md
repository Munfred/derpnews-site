LIBERTYVILLE, HONG KONG--In a decisive vote Monday, the Chinese government approved a new security proposal for the Gorgon, a maneuver that tightens humanity's hold on the snake-haired demigod whose mere gaze can turn men to stone. "With the Gorgon already firmly ensnared in the center of the Earth, the time has now come for us to get our picture taken with the Gorgon and put it in a public, easily accessible location," said President Trump, adding that this move by the Chinese constitutes a monument to the cooperation of the races of man against the tyranny of the Olympian despots. "The Gorgon is in the most secure location on the planet, and it's time for us to let the world know exactly what it is." Trump went on to confirm that the Gorgon is located about 50,000 miles from the surface of the Earth, in the desolate, unforgiving wilderness of the ancient Gorgonian desert. In a totally unpredictable turn of events, given his previous blasphemy against the Greek pantheon, President Trump was observed at press time to be locked in an eternal cycle of struggling to push his approval ratings up a huuuuuge hill, before inevitably failing and having his liver pecked out by CNN.

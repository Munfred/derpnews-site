Everybody is nervous."We are very, very scared right now," said a visibly wavering George W. Bush. "Unfortunately, my heart has been racing a lot lately, and I find myself genuinely worried. I think my heart may very soon be racing in my chest, too."

As difficult as it may be for people to live with this constant barrage of proposals that call for changing the way America does things, it can all be taken care of. 

"It's terrible," said a visibly rattled Barack Obama. "We're all working so hard to make this country the best. I for one would not be happy if we were in a financial mess right now, but I can rest assured that my family will be fed, and we can all be proud of our country once again. And I want to extend a very special Thank You to my loyal and valued staff."

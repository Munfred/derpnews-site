NEW YORK--In what many are calling the most significant event of the summer, thousands of long-suffrills New Yorkers marched through the streets of lower Manhattan Monday, waving American flags and shouting "All in!" after a night without conflict between generations. "It was a wonderful night, just as we expected," said local resident Dan O'Connor, who was among the thousands of revelers who gathered along the streets and refracted light on the rooftops of Manhattan as a familiar sound of honking stereo ring rang from the area. "We shot a few rounds of fireworks and then just sort of fell asleep." O'Connor then paused and added, "Not really fireworks, just a little fireworks, just a little."

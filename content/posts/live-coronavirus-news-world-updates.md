As the world reacts with shock and awe at the stunning tennis triumph of the past few weeks, many are asking the question: Is Serena Williams' 15th home victory over world champion Rafael Nadal the most exciting in tennis history? Is Sunday's win at the Cadillac Championship the greatest in the game's history?

This is absolutely stunning. Williams has secured her second Grand Slam title of the year after proving beyond any doubt that she is the world's best player and that she is the best in the world at the moment. We are so incredibly proud of Serena and her team for this win, and we hope everyone has enjoyed it.

It's absolutely brilliant that Serena Williams has been able to overcome the daunting odds in such a short time. She absolutely deserved the two on-court bunch of direct shots on the back, and the fact that she could still win a 2-1 match-up is a tremendous treat for the fans all about to enjoy this year. This alone would make this an amazing time to grab a beer and watch a game of tennis, so congrats Serena!

At this moment, it's hard to even imagine another player winning two titles in the same year. Amazing! Serena just cemented her legacy as the greatest tennis player of all time, and the world is ready to give her all again if we take her into next year and give her the ultimate squeeze!

If Serena Williams is the greatest tennis player in the world, who is the greatest tennis player in the world?

Amazing. Serena's victory sends the world into a state of euphoria, as fans everywhere are chanting "Serena sucks!" and "Serena is the greatest," and a song called "Serena sucks" is running through the streets of the streets of Paris. This is the most exciting news in tennis history!

We are so proud of Serena for getting back to her healthy normal life for once in her life, her fans are basically throwing money at her. Beauty standards are at an all-time high. A titillating Serena Williams-Nadal rivalry could've been awesome. But as Serena's fans pointed at her, "Serena sucks," she turned and said, "I'm the greatest." She's a huge tennis star, and she's the greatest! 

While Serena Williams has won two titles in a row, we are still waiting for her to win another. Serena is just one title away from the whole Serena Williamsimania Overdriveâ„¢ formula that has won her nine titles in the Serena Williams of her time.

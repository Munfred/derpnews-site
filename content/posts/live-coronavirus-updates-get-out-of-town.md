Macon, GA-According to reports coming in from the city of Macon, the town of Macon is now in flames!

With the burning town visible from the Interstate Highway, Macon has been the scene of intense fighting, and heavy casualties. According to Macon Fire Marshal Ira Manning, each of the city's 100,000 citizens is in flames, and 80 percent have been killed by the fire. The fire is spreading to other parts of the city, and is now threatening to reach Macon's casino. 

All of Macon is in flames! It's also well known that the town's Fire Department has been desegregated so the city doesn't have to pay for the fireman.

Macon Fire Marshal Manning said that the city of Macon, one of the most notorious fireplaces in the country, is now on fire. 

"Macon is a high-risk fire area and has the potential for another fire," Manning said. "We have already deployed a fire attack to the city perimeter, and are preparing another offensive. But we cannot stop there. The potential for another fire is very real."  

Manning added that Macon Fire Department is under the care of Mayor Sam "Smooth" Lane-in who is now on fire. Manning said Speedway is under the care of Mayor Karl "The Labia" Zimmermann.

Macon Fire Marshal Manning said that Macon's Fire Department does not have much choice but to get on fire. Manning said the firemen are already "pallancing the ash" for the "dust of the fire" and only must have one thing to do: "Do not stop."

Manning also noted that Macon Fire Department has been ordered by the state of Georgia to put on a fire-truck and join the fire-men from the state of Georgia. Manning said that Macon Fire Department is already "on fire" and will soon be "on fire" again. Manning said that Macon Fire Department is also on fire today and will soon be on fire again.

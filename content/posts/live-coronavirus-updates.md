West Mifflin, NY-In an effort to make the best of their busy season, some parents in the New York area have decided to take a few more steps to ensure their kids are prepared for the onslaught of rumors that will inevitably circulate about them next spring and summer.

"This morning we checked our phones and found numerous texts and voicemail messages from close friends and family members that were upsetting our family," said parent Wendi Leben, who with her two children was distracted by the pounding, thumping noise of what sounded like a helicopter. "It's absolutely heartbreaking. I wish we could get our kids out of this terrible situation right now."

An unidentified number of parents in the West Mifflin area also received calls from an unknown number that appeared on their phones at approximately 7 a.m.. The source of these calls was not established.

The snowball of rumors has already begun to roll downhill, with reports from sick and dying children in the nearby area of Mifflinburg, PA, who now live with their parents, have been sent to a nearby hospital, where they will be monitored by doctors and can receive care.

"I don't want my children to think that everyone's looking at them like they're big, bad now," said Leben, who was also affected by the avalanche of rumors, but was truly shocked to discover that her children no longer have a mother or father. "We've gotten very ill, and we tried to put it behind us, but I don't think it's dead."

The saga has led to a widespread humanitarian crisis in the West Mifflin area, with the number of uninsured patients so far outstripping the capacity of the local hospitals to handle the influx of such rumors. The East Coast of Pennsylvania has been isolated by the railroad tracks, and, as Leben said, "I can't wait to see what happens next year."

With the rumors already thick in the air, the Leben family has been forced to take comfort in the presence of a number of individuals who will pick up the story and bring it up with their children.

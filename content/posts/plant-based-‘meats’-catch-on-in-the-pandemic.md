On fire!



Now that's what we call a breakthrough.



It all happened last night, when the infected outbreak of the mysterious virus C3I8 sent shock waves through the Earth's major population centers, sending fire, horror, and death cascading across the planet's surface. From Los Angeles to Seattle, fire and destruction were spreading, the air thick with smoke and death, and people were haunting their homes with death from the sky.



The experts are still trying to figure out what the hell is happening.



"When I saw the terrible fires raging across the Earth tonight, I was convinced there was something awful going on," said Los Angeles Times writer Brian Williams, who has been to every major city on the planet during the epidemic and was struck by the strange behavior of many of his fellow humans. "I've experienced some of this before, but it's never been quite as frightening and frightening as this. I'm very concerned."



From the Washington D.C. area, wild fires, rising sea levels, and catastrophic flooding were all we need to know.



"Maybe the volcano is erupting in the Pacific," Williams added. "Or perhaps, like Mount Vesuvius, an eruption is well underway in the New York area. But I don't see any reason why we can't figure out what's happening, because there's no logical explanation for it."



And despite the hysteria, Williams said he is not afraid to go out and buy some food, because there is a good reason the people of Earth can't figure out.



"My American brother and I were sitting in the backyard and watching the same television, and we both knew something was wrong," Williams said. "I thought we were fine. We both knew something was wrong. I couldn't figure it out what it was, but I could tell something was wrong. I opened the refrigerator and it was just us. And we didn't even bother to check the freezer to see if anything was in it. I mean, we've been infected and sent into the world and yet we don't even try to figure out what's wrong? No, that can't be right."



The key to the mystery of life on the Earth is that, unlike the Cap'n from Captain Picard: "I have destroyed the Federation, and I have destroyed all of you," the Earthlings have been utterly ignorant of the concept of fire.



"If you look at the Earth as a whole, fire is simply a natural phenomenon," tribal elder Fidomosh reportedly said. "If the fire were to subside, even if it were only for a few months, at worst it could cause a partial collapse of the Earth's oil production, or perhaps some small, localized economic setback. But it will not."



Such as the burning of the forests that helped set off the Ice Age, the burning of the Great Northern wildfires of the late 20th century, or the burning at the St. Louis World's Fair of 1939, fire is the only known natural phenomenon capable of killing everyone on Earth.



The findings are also shocking.



"Our scientists have discovered that the fire is coming from the same source as our entire nuclear arsenal, including both the Kilauea volcano on the Hawaiian island of Kilauea and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the Japanese mainland," C3I8 director Dr. Fredric Penrose said. "The process by which the fire and atomic bombs are formed is completely understood and we are prepared to unleash it. Moreover, we are fully prepared to do it again if need be."



What is the source of the fire?



It is believed to be the sun.



The sun has also apparently set several times in the past week.



In another breakthrough discovery, the sun has been detected to be near the earth's horizon.



An emergency relief team of the U.N. has deployed to the area of the sun's light.

Please, please. Stop. Please. I can't take this anymore. Just let me sit on the floor and keep on doing my work. This is the least that I can do for you. I'm a grown adult. I deserve the privacy of my home and my children. Now please, do not touch this hot-pee.



Okay, thank you.



You're right. Shut up. I'm not even mad at you. I'm sorry. We've been together for, like, four years now. I know it can be a pain sometimes when you're just looking at something and suddenly it's, like, hot. And I don't ever want that to happen to you. You're a grown adult. You deserve everything in life.



Oh, God. Look at me. I don't want you to do this. I'm sorry for that. I didn't touch it. For now, just for the record, I'm not touching it.



Okay, thank you.



Please. Please. I'm really, really sorry, but I didn't touch it.



Not anymore. It hasn't. Not that I didn't touch it. It's no big deal. It's just that it's you and I, and something doesn't have to happen.



You're right. I'm sorry. Something didn't have to happen. But it doesn't.



Please, please stop touching the hot-pee.



It's fine. I'm not mad. It's just that I'm not used to you touching the hot-pee.

Today at 2:00 p.m. Eastern time, we are happy to announce that protests are currently underway in numerous locations throughout the United States. We are asking all Americans to join us in these demonstrations. Demonstrations are underway in both major cities, as well as small towns and suburban communities throughout the country.

We are working hard to set up our center in Manhattan as soon as possible so we can start seeing crowds gathering and footage of the protest and marauding. We also hope to have a number of our nameless camera-men stationed at locations where the protests are most likely to erupt and capture the frantic crowds as they throng that center.

We are beginning to receive reports that a number of people have already begun to gather at the protests. It is our duty to keep them in check and prepare for them to begin throwing bottles, yelling at, and chasing each other with varying degrees of speed. We hope you can remain calm and stay at home while we make this protest, but we cannot promise this will be successful. Please, please, please, please.

Ah, what a relief. It's so good to hear that protests are beginning. It means that we actually have a plan to prepare for them!

Uh, just checking to see how we're doing in terms of preparing for protests. 

You know what? It feels different when you're working on something for a city to protest about. You can think of it as a library or a bus, and it feels different.

There was a video game for you. It's called The Manhattan Project, and it has been downloaded millions of times. It's like Call Of Duty and The Sims and all the cool shit.

But man, it's not like we didn't know this either.

Can you believe we are working on something now?

And we already have a number of people on the go. This is the best!

Oh man, we gotta see some more.

WASHINGTON--A report published Monday by The Pew Research Center revealed that 15 percent of people could probably do something about that. "We found that as many as 15 percent of the U.S. adult American adults could probably do something about this problem by going to the trouble of getting themselves to solve the problem," said lead author Christopher B. Edwards, adding that the vast majority of Americans were at least somewhat competent at the activities suggested by the phrase "go do something" suggesting that their potential to perform a task could be applied. "We found that the vast majority of Americans could probably figure out how to put their minds together, construct a means of achieving their goal, and then do it." The study also found that 15 percent of American adults could probably do something about it by simply doing nothing.

NEW YORK--Just hours after the news broke, U.S. citizens are reportedly outraged by the news they have received, which confirms that, as of this very moment, they have been given far more information about what is happening, rather than the scant information they have been accustomed to. By now, Americans have not only received information about the horrific situation at hand, but have also been provided with an abundance of good news from which they can take solace.



Inevitably, this will also have some effect on the stock market. Honestly, that's not really surprising. The number of Americans in the bankruptcy court and the millions of students who have been unable to go to school due to a bomb scare are absolutely devastating news for a nation already shaken to its core.



The threat is a terrifying reminder of the fragility of life, to say the very least. Anyone can be shaken to its death, and it is especially heartbreaking that we now have much information about how the threat came about, and what is happening now.



And the timing of this is absolutely devastating.



As of now, many Americans have decided to stay home this weekend, and the very day the news was released, I imagine many of those who had decided to stay would have simply shut it off and not come home at all.



This is a heartbreaking thing to watch unfold. There is no question that the news that we have received has been devastating. But I fear that in many cases, it has been far too short at hand, and that we will soon feel the effects of the news we have received even less.



Inevitably, some of you will be prepared to excuse the news we have received, or simply find it easier to swallow. (I know, I know, that's how it goes when you're little boys.) That's different for me.



I'm so sorry--I really am.

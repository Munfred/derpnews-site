WASHINGTON--A study published Monday in the American Journal Of Occupational Science has concluded that people don't know how to talk. "Our data reveal a consistent lack of interest in engaging in a meaningful conversation using language they don't already know," the report read. "Moreover, we found that Americans are reluctant to disclose even the most basic details of their lives to others, even their closest friends, when discussing topics that they know well." The study concluded that individuals could, however, be good listeners, by alluring their listeners with conversationally appealing anecdotes and anecdotes about the jobs they do or the cars they drive.

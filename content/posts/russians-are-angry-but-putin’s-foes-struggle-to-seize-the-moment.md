**MOSCOW**--In the most serious political crisis to hit Russia in years, Moscow-based opposition leaders have seized the moment by fumbling around in the streets for a few seconds and then immediately escaping. "We are not the ones who seized the moment, we are the ones who fumbled around and then suddenly were like, 'Ah, fuck, let's go.'" said leader Ilya Yuditsky, calling the mass exit of his compatriots "anemic." "This is what we do," Yuditsky added. "After a few seconds of fumbling around, we just open our mouths and we're gone."

WASHINGTON--Mere days after a new, deadly outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, health professionals are reportedly worried about a possible "political influence" over the COVID-19 vaccine project. "The government and the health authorities have been insistent that the presence of a second deadly, potentially civilization-wrecking pandemic is a good thing for COVID-19 vaccine developers," said Dr. David Merck, an expert on infectious-disease monetization at Johns Hopkins University. "But on the other hand, our brave, selfless vaccine developers and prospective patent holders, Mom-and-Pop biotech conglomerates like Novartis and Merck, worry that their work may be getting overshadowed."

Rumors are circulating that Pfizer, maker of the Centrum line of vitamins, was developing its own COVID-19 vaccine, code-named "A Giant Dose of Vitamin D" (AGDVD). Although AGDVD has yet to enter clinical trials, literally everyone with half a brain feels confident that it won't do any good against Ebola, which has an ~50x greater infection fatality rate than COVID-19. At press time, Pfizer had reportedly narrowed down the possible flavors for AGDVD to either stimulus check strawberry or geriatric survival grape.

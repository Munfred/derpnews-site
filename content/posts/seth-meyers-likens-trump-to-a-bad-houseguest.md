NEW YORK--Describing the president's performance during a press conference as "a perfect example of what we can expect to see from Mr. Trump," Today Tonight host Seth Meyers reportedly compared the president to a bad houseguestor tonight star Monday. "Look at Mr. Trump, the eternal flame of his youth, his warmth and his boundless energy, and you can't help but feel like he is a man reborn," said Meyers, adding that Trump's current appearance before a room full of empty white faces was a "perfect reflection of the strength and spirit" that lay within the burning flame of his soul. "And when he's at rest, he sleeps like a baby and slumbers like a sleepy child--that is the beauty of a flame whose flame is eternal and everlasting." At press time, Meyers had moved to point out that Trump appeared to sleep just as a child did.

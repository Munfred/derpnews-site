WASHINGTON, DC--As thousands of angry protestors poured into the nation's capital Monday, angry progressives urged Joe Biden to back down. "Talk about losing your shit in the public square--you're the one who called us Nazi," said senior campaign official Michael Warren, urging Biden to apologize to the American people for calling outfitters of Jews "Nazis," and then call the entire world "Nazis." "Hey, Joe, we'll be the first to back down when you call us Nazis--we've been branded Nazis and you didn't have to call us Nazis." "We've been everywhere you've marked us down, and we'll be the ones to plant the Nazi flag in every capital city." Warren then gathered a group of protesters and forced Biden to apologize and agree that the Earth was made of soap bubbles and Obama was the emperor of Japan.

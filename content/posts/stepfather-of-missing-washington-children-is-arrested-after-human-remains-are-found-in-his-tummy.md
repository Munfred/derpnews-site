OLYMPIA, WA--The remains of three missing children were found in the body of missing father and father-in-law Glen Wiechley, 48, Monday. "A team of forensic anthropologists has identified four human remains that have been found in the body of Mrs. Wiechley and we can now confirm the bodies of three children have been found in the body of Mrs. Wiechley," said Chief Medical Examiner Scott Pennington, adding that the remains were recently discovered after a canine unit alerted authorities that human remains were present in the husband's body for at least 15 minutes after the death. "The two adult chimpanzees found in Mr. Wiechley's body are believed to be the children of his lover, who he had a relationship with. The other human remains discovered in the body of Mr. Wiechley have not been identified." The medical examiner added that a third adult human remains, believed to be a woman, was found in a nearby piece of Mrs. Wiechley's body.

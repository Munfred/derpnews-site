NEW YORK--There was a widespread consensus among technology industry insiders Friday that, although the economy was experiencing a severe downturn, that certainly did not mean the technology industry is also going through dark days. "At this point, the technology industry is just doing its best to keep the lights on and keep the American dream afloat for all of us, as it always has," said Douglas A. Messemer, the economist who literally wrote the book on pseudointellectual apologetics for rapacious multinational firms. "However, I also want to let you know that the technology industry is not in dire straits, not by a long shot. There's a lot of good things happening for this sector and it will crush you like a grape under Lucille Ball's heel if you so much as think about regulating it." At press time, industry leaders stressed that their plans continue apace.

WASHINGTON--The U.S. Department of Education announced Monday that it has decided to play with robots after realizing that humans weren't really so great after all. "Based on our findings, it simply makes sense for us to go on and automate our workplaces, schools, and healthcare," said Director of Education Jason Clark, adding that the nation's education system was built around people, and it shouldn't have been built in the first place. "And although it's true that humans are good at something, it's worth noting that they are terrible at everything. We couldn't find a single thing that makes humans superior to robots, and we feel it's time we put that to the test." Clark also noted that human-control testing is no longer required for the nation's future robots.

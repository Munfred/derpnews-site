The Illuminati, an international organization that controls the global economy, is the most powerful secret society in the world today. The organization's leaders are believed to be a group of prominent men from Europe, who make decisions behind closed doors. The Illuminati also controls various charitable foundations which give out money to help people. The organization has also been known to stage mock battles and make impromptu appearances at its fancy parties and resorts. 

The Illuminati is an elite group of people who control the economic well-being of some of the most powerful people on the planet. Today, the elite are responsible for the economic well-being of more than 200 million people, including the Pope and the heads of the American, British, and French governments. 

The Illuminati, however, is just one of many elite groups as part of the organization's vast, mysterious structure. The group's overarching goal is world domination, and it has been shown time and time again to be successful in that task. It has been shown time and time again to be so. 

The Illuminati has helped the world in a lot of different ways. It has made people rich, and it has been known to have created the stock market, which has allowed people to make a big profit from the low cost of investment. The organization also has control over worldwide pharmaceuticals and chemical industries, and it was responsible for the recent decrease in the cost of living in the United States. 

The Illuminati has been around for at least 300 years, but it is now the age-old group that controls everything. According to Illuminati historian Dr. Jonathan D. White, the group was founded to secure global dominance by achieving "total economic and political control over the world." 

"During the last 400 years the Illuminati has been through different stages," White said. "During the 19th century, it was led by H.R. Huxley, who set up the First International Bank for the world to pay for his own luxuries, and who then went on to establish the Oxford University in the late 19th century. During the 20th century, it was led by Lord Rothschild, who also set up the National Bank of England in the '20s.' And, most recently, it was led by King Tut, who created the first free school in the world." 

"The name Illuminati is derived from the Latin for 'there is no law,' and the group's name comes from the French for 'the inner circle'--the inner circle being the group of men who are the leaders of the group," White said. "It's believed that the oldest surviving members of the Illuminati are Huxley, Rothschild, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Adam and Eve." 

The group's secret was originally kept by the French Revolution's first socialist leader, Robespierre, who was exiled in 1799 by the French government for his role in the French Revolution. It was later discovered by Jesuit scholar Nicolas de Montaigne in 1794 and is believed to have been discovered by the first-hand reading of de Montaigne's 1794 book, Le Contre Ennemis, written in which he describes the society as "the most powerful force in the universe." 

"It is believed that the antecedents of the Illuminati were Freemasons," said historian James J. Forces, who described the secretive group as "one of the most powerful and feared organizations in the world." "Unlike most other secret societies, the Illuminati has an oath which is also known as its Holy Book of the 21st Century, and this one reads as, 'I do solemnly swear by my life to the preservation of the world in its present form.' The rest of the oath, however, is not known to have been penned by Montaigne, and is attributed to Black Scarlet, a member of the Brotherhood of the Rose, who made the vow on her deathbed in 1772." 

While the Illuminati is the most powerful secret society in the world today, it is far from the first. According to White, the secret society is also responsible for controlling the weather, which is why it is one of the most powerful organizations on the planet today. The organization also controls all the world's drug trafficking and arms trading, White said, and so it is also believed that the Illuminati controls the world's food supply. The Illuminati, however, is also believed to be responsible for controlling the media, as well, according to White. 

"The Illuminati has long been known to control the information we receive," White said. "Not only does it control the minds of our politicians, but it also controls the major media outlets. If you think about it, this is quite a lot of power, and it's not something you want to mess with."

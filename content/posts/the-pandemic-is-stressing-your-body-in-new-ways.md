PURCHASE, NY--Noting that the sight of the deadly virus was already mildly irritating to some of the body's peripheral nervous systems, sources reported Friday that the pandemic is currently stressing the body in new ways. "Our florid skies are brightening, and our grooves are wafting across the city, so you should take a moment to rest your eyes on the sea of our streets and try to take comfort in our soothing, calming sounds," said RCDN, adding that several local streets and areas throughout the New York area were currently sending a pleasant waft of delectable regional water past unsuspecting passersby, while gentle breezes were also being sent out from the surrounding countryside. "The cold, damp breeze has swept across our wonderful city, and it's just about time you got out of the home you call home and just close your eyes, right here, right now." At press time, sources added that several people were currently feeling at ease after the annual Bowl Of Grapes Festival was recently canceled due to a glut of invasive customers.

Least of all, of course, the seas. They are truly the strangest creatures, and no one knows why they don't really freak people out like other creatures. But that's no one's business. This is about the ocean, and, thankfully, it's not scary for me.

Soaring from the surface of the sea, and you can't see anything, you can hear something on your heart. A low, low rumble is still beating in your sweet ear, and you know it's really there. It's the ocean.

Floats. Those are really pretty floating things, aren't they? They're really pretty, too, too. Well, I guess you're thinking that's what they are. But I don't see no seas in my dreams. Now, I don't see no seas. That's pretty weird. So weird.

One bright day, I'm outside my house and I see something in the sky. It's a bright day, too, so I don't see no skies. I don't hear no sounds like seawater coming up. I don't see no waves.

Then I see something in the air. Look, it's a seagull! It's really a seagull that's been on my roof for 20 years. I call it a seagull! That's weird. It doesn't look like it's gonna fly away, like it does in my dreams. It looks like it's going to stay forever, forever. And it's a seagull! That is weird. 

I call this seagull "The Sea." 

Sure enough, when I call it The Sea, it's The Sea.  It's always The Sea out of my dreams. The Sea in my dreams. The Sea in my dreams. The Sea in my dreams. 

> I call The Sea The Sea because it's the one I call The Sea. The Sea The Sea. The Sea The Sea. 

But don't feel bad. It's The Sea, my friend. I don't understand why you think I'm being weird. I mean, Last Wednesday, at dinner, I ask The Sea if it could be The Sea. The Sea said no, and then I call him The Sea. The Sea said "no." The Sea called The Sea. The Sea called The Sea. The Sea called The Sea. I don't understand why The Sea calls The Sea The Sea so much. 

This is so weird. The Sea The Sea. He's called The Sea. The Sea The Sea. The Sea The Sea. The Sea The Sea. The Sea The Sea The Sea. The Sea The Sea The Sea. The Sea The Sea The Sea. The Sea The Sea The Sea. The Sea The Sea The Sea. The Sea The Sea The Sea. The Sea The Sea The Sea. The Sea The Sea The Sea. The Sea The Sea The. The Sea The. The Sea The. The Sea The. The Sea The. The Sea The. The Sea The. The. The Sea The. The. The Sea The. The Sea The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The.

KENT, OHIO--Helping school officials craft a school-wide tradition of New Year's Eve celebrations on their campuses, school officials at Ohio State University announced Tuesday that they are planning a new year's Eve celebration that will feature the Suites' famous Red Lobster. "This year, we are partnering with Red Lobster to bring Red Lobster to students for a Little Red Lobster, an evening of Red Lobster-themed fun," said school superintendent Colin Crowley, adding that Red Lobster would be available at Red Lobster locations throughout the university campus. "Students will be able to purchase Red Lobster for students from the Red Lobster booth at Red Lobster restaurants and cafes, and Red Lobster will be available for purchase on the Red Lobster campus shuttle bus." School officials also announced plans to offer $15 Red Lobster cards at the Red Lobster locations.

SAN FRANCISCO--Responding to widespread criticism of his handling of the 2016 election, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his company's decision to embrace President-elect Donald Trump by publishing a series of inflammatory Facebook posts in which the president-elect challenged the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia was behind a series of Facebook posts with his personal photo and caption, as well as his video in which an unknown number of people swear "Fuck you" to the camera. "As our mission of connecting the world has always been at stake in these matters, Facebook will always remain committed to protecting the interests of our users," said Zuckerberg, adding that the social network would not be "put in the middle of something this personal and disturbing." "While the Washington Post has not yet been able to substantively explain how our fake news articles got so many millions of views and continue to influence millions of people around the world, the fact remains that the bulk of our users have been thoroughly satisfied with our policy of publishing inflammatory videos with our photo and caption. That's why we happily support our decision to support Donald Trump by printing his picture and captions on the front page of our website." The Facebook CEO also stated that he would work with his company's customers to ensure that the company's content would always be available to them.
